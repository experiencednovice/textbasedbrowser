Show Tildes: Midnight.pub, a virtual pub
~misc
Three weeks ago I decided I should stop developing on my own and open my side project to get feedback. So here we are now.
Midnight pub is a writing platform that aims to be the virtual equivalent of a pub: you go there to talk about your day, interact with a person or two while you unwind, and leave whenever you feel like. It's centered around the idea of entries & references (backlinks) to connect entries together.
It's a small community of people at the moment. Anyone is welcome to drop by and say hi!

Discussion thread for Hamilton's streaming/theatrical release
~arts
theatre
spoiler
I may or may not have stayed up all night watching it.
I'd be interested in knowing what everyone's previous exposure / experience to Hamilton is, before seeing this version of it.
I've listened to the cast recording a million times, and saw the touring production once when it came to Seattle.
I'm sure I'll have more cogent thoughts later, after sleeping on it / watching it a second time...one thing I noticed that stuck in my mind is that besides censoring the two "fucks"

What are the best games you've played so far this year?
~games
We're halfway through 2020 (can you believe it?) and I'm curious to know what everyone's highlights are so far. They don't have to be games released in 2020, just ones that you've played in 2020. Let us know what they are and why you took to them.

Anyone else diagnosed with depression? I need others to talk to
~health
mental health
Hello,
So I've been officially diagnosed with depression a few years ago. I am on medication for it and I've done therapy in the past. I am a more functional person than I was, let's say, one year ago as I've adjusted my medication.
However there is something that is SEVERELY affecting my quality of life and that is the generalized lack of interest or extreme difficulty in doing almost anything. Yes I've talked with my doctor about this. It's "normal" and we are working on it.
I don't know many people and COVID-19 took a hit on my already limited social life. So I guess I want to share my experience and hear from others who experience(ed) the same difficulties. When you are trapped in not wanting to do anything, what the hell do you do?
Recently I've started reading a physical book again. I think it is a good thing for me to have something to do that does not involve a screen. Plus it makes me sleepy if I am a bit tired which, for me personally, is great. Aside from this next experiment, the activities I do the most are playing one or two video games, study for my degree and work part-time.
Another thing I've started doing is doing the bare minimum in terms of physical exercise. I am working on doing pull-ups (I went from doing 0 to 1,5 =) ) and doing some squats. School and work rob me of a lot of energy so I tend not to exercise. But now I'm trying to at least do something.
I will try to keep up with this post but I have a tendency to procrastinate on them if I get a lot of replies. Thanks for bearing with me =).

Victoria records 108 new coronavirus infections, locks down suburbs and public housing
~health.coronavirus
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-04/coronavirus-numbers-victoria-rise-again-lockdown-suburbs/12422456
Victoria recorded its second-highest ever daily increase in coronavirus cases, with 108 people diagnosed with the virus overnight.
Residents of nine public housing estates in inner Melbourne will be required to stay in their homes due to an outbreak of coronavirus cases.
23 cases had been identified in more than 12 households in the Flemington and North Melbourne public housing estates
the nine towers included 1,345 units of housing and were home to about 3,000 residents.
"No-one will be allowed out of those public housing towers," Mr Andrews said.
I just watched the press conference. This article misses some details.
The residents of these public housing towers will not be allowed to leave their flats/apartments
This is an extreme lockdown, beyond anything done in Australia so far.
Over the next few days, all residents in the towers will be tested for coronavirus. The lockdown is expected to last for
